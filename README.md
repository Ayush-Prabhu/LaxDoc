# LaxDoc
This is a project of Navmarg [navmarg.in].

Requirements:
OS: Windows 10/11, Linux (Debian based preferred) - 64 bit
Python
Venv
PHP

To run on windows: run LaxDoc.bat

To run on Linux: run LaxDoc.sh

[Edit: Above commands are having some trouble in some os due to security restrictions]

Manual method
1. extract myenv, (make sure that extarction is in the current directory itself and not in another folder in it, i.e. pwd>myvenv>[lib,scripts...] is correct, pwd>myvenv>myvenv>[lib,scripts...] is incorrect).
2. run LaxDoc.bat on windows.
3. on linux the current venv might not work the right way, hence instead of unzipping this zip file, manually create a venv in pwd and install the required dependencies.
